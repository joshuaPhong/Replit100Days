# Alright Top Trumpers. Your program should work like this.
#
# Pick a category. Something popular. You know like 'most handsome computer science teachers'. ðŸ˜†
# Store the information of two different objects in a 2D dictionary.
# The key field should be name.
# The data in the sub dictionary should be some stats about the object. For example:
# Intelligence
# Handsomeness
# L33t c0ding skillz
# Baldness level
# Use an infinite loop to get the user to pick one of the two cards, then pick a stat from that card.
# Display the chosen stat for both cards and output which has won.
# ðŸ¥³ Extra points for:
#
# Making the dictionary dynamic, so you can add your own cards.
# Using a loop to play the game in a 2 player format, keeping track of points scored.
